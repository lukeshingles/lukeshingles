I'm an experienced researcher with a PhD in computational astrophysics. I'm skilled in high-performance computing, scientific software development (including Python/C/MPI/OpenMP), data analysis, and visualisation.

I have experience developing and using software on various supercomputers to solve systems of differential equations (e.g., for stellar structure and nuclear reaction networks) and carry out large-scale (>1000 core) Monte Carlo simulations of radiation and particle transport. I have a strong interest in computer graphics, performance optimisation, and enjoy learning new technologies. I would like to develop my knowledge of GPU programming (CUDA/OpenCL), machine learning, and computer vision (OpenCV).
